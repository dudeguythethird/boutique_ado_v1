# Boutique Ado - E-commerce app.

This is a Django full stack app. I copied the code for it, as part of a series of lessons in my Code Institute course, to teach me the Django framework. It features stripe payments, user authentication and a large database of products. 

I will soon be creating a milestone project with a similar featureset, using Django. This will have a full ReadMe file, unlike this tutorial project.
